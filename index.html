  <h1>~ our story ~</h1>
  <div class="blurb"> 
  <h3 class="text-box center-any-elem">Jobby.pk started with the aim of empowering the casual part of the workforce. In Pakistan, unlike foreighn countries, where people fill their gaps between employment, student expenditures e.t.c. with casual work, there is no outlet to facilitate them.<br><br>A big reason for this is that the casual job market is un-developed and there are no mechanisms to facilitate this. We want to promote casual work in Paksitan and want to give people financial freedom to pursue and finace their dreams, while being able to decrease financail dependency on family and their savings between periods of financial need.
